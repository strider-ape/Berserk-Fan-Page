            <div class="tale-text">
                Blood stains the earth where hope once dared to grow. Beneath a sky bruised by the screams of the fallen, Guts carves his path through a world of betrayal and agony. Each swing of his massive blade defies fate-a howl against the darkness closing in. Shadows gather not just in the night but within men: Griffith’s ambition burns cold and bright, while Casca’s courage flickers amid war’s storm. Even the strongest bonds are torn apart by dreams too grand for mortals. Haunted by loss and driven by rage, Guts presses on-a battered soul in a land where mercy is forgotten. In this endless struggle, every scar tells a story, and every step forward is a triumph over a destiny written in suffering and blood.

            Haunted by shadows and driven by rage, <span class="highlight">Guts</span> carves his path through a world steeped in darkness. With the Dragonslayer in hand and scars as his armor, he stands as the storm against fate itself-unyielding, unstoppable, unforgettable.
